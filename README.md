This is a personal implimentation of the AES encription algorithm in c. It has not been sufficiently vetted for security issues to be used for any sensitive application. It has been created for personal educational purposes only. No code has been directly written by AI, every line has been typed through a keyboard, AI autocomplete has been dissabled. AI has been used to provide insight, help with debugging and to write temporary debugging code to help print variables etc (this will have been removed by the time of the commit labled 'final'). This is a personal rule I have applied to ensure that every bit of code is intentional and I understand every component of the algorithm.
