###  Personal AI Policy
No code in the core directory has been written by AI and AI autocomplete was dissabled, this was to make sure that everything was intentional. AI was used to create test code, by giving it specific test vectors to format into tests. The logic of this was that since this is code that since this is code that only runs once to verify everything is working, it is less critical that it is meticulously thought through or well structured. However, upon reflection it became obvious that the AI code was not up to sufficient standard, and time was spent rewriting it, finding sources for the data, and debugging it when it made false assumptions about how the program worked.
